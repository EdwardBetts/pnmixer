.SH NAME
pnmixer \- a mixer for the system tray
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pnmixer
.RB [\| \fIOPTION\fP \|]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpnmixer\fP is a simple mixer application designed to run in your system
tray. It integrates nicely into desktop environments that don't have
a panel that supports applets and therefore can't run a mixer applet.
In particular it's been used quite a lot with \fIfbpanel\fP and \fItint2\fP,
but should run fine in any system tray.

\fBpnmixer\fP is designed to work on systems that use \fIALSA\fP
for sound management. Any other sound driver like \fIOSS\fP or \fIFFADO\fP
are currently not supported (patches welcome). \fBpnmixer\fP has been reported
to work well with \fIPulseAudio\fP, but we lack feedback on this matter.

.SH OPTIONS
\fBpnmixer\fP follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
